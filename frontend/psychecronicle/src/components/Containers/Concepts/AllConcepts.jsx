    "Cognitive Dissonance": "The mental discomfort experienced when a person holds two or more contradictory beliefs, values, or attitudes. This theory, developed by Leon Festinger, suggests that people are motivated to reduce this dissonance by changing their attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors.",
    "Classical Conditioning": "A learning process that occurs when two stimuli are repeatedly paired. A response initially elicited by the second stimulus is eventually elicited by the first stimulus alone. Pavlov's experiments with dogs are a well-known example.",
    "Operant Conditioning": "A method of learning that occurs through rewards and punishments for behavior. Through operant conditioning, an association is made between a behavior and a consequence (Skinner).",

It assumes that all behaviors are either reflexes produced by a response to certain stimuli or a consequence of the individual's history, including especially reinforcement and punishment (Watson and Skinner).",
    "Social Learning Theory": "The theory that people can learn through observation and imitation of others. Albert Bandura's Bobo doll experiment demonstrated that children could learn aggressive behaviors by watching others.",

    "Cognitive Development": "A field of study in neuroscience and psychology focusing on a child's development in terms of information processing, conceptual resources, perceptual skill, language learning, and other aspects of brain development.
